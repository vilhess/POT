# Unofficial Implementation of Anomaly Detection in Streams with Extreme Value Theory  

🔗 **Paper:** [Anomaly Detection in Streams with Extreme Value Theory](https://hal.science/hal-01640325/)  

This repository provides an implementation of the **SPOT** and **DSPOT** algorithms from the paper *Anomaly Detection in Streams with Extreme Value Theory*.  

## 📌 About  

The implementation is heavily based on the original code by:

## 🛠️ Code Structure  

- **`pot.py`** – Contains the implementation of SPOT and DSPOT algorithms.  
- **`experiments.ipynb`** – A Jupyter notebook showcasing experiments on both **stationary** and **non-stationary** streaming data.  

## 🎯 Use Case  

This method is useful for anomaly detection in streaming data, and it has been particularly helpful in my thesis research on this topic.
